# System Initialization for Flatcar Container Linux

Flatcar uses systemd for init and process management. This repo is
divided into three collections of files:

* configs: Customized daemon configuration files, usually installed into
  `/etc` but really the sky is the limit there.
* scripts: Helper scripts for init and service startup. These are generally to
  be used as systemd oneshot services and installed into `/usr/lib/flatcar`.
* systemd: Unit files for mount points, our helper scripts, or other services
  that don't install their own unit files.

The coreos-base/coreos-init ebuild handles the install process.

## Important Steps

A few notes on things that must happen which are unique to Flatcar.

* resize btrfs: Support easy VM growth by checking if there is unused space at
  the end of the disk and expanding the filesystem to use it.
* mount `/`: This directory can be completely empty.
* initialize `/`: The `/` partition can be completely formatted by the
  user. Run systemd-tmpfiles to set everything up into a known state.
* mount `/usr`: The entire distro lives in this directory.
* mount `/oem`: If an OEM is available on disk make sure it gets mounted here.
* generate ssh keys: The stock sshd units do not handle this so we need to.
